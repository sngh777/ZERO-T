# Zero-Trust CI/CD Pipeline with Integrated Security

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a secure CI/CD pipeline based on Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) principles. The pipeline integrates various open-source tools to ensure security, compliance, and automation at every stage of the software development lifecycle. It enforces strict access controls, continuous verification, automated security checks, and robust monitoring, ensuring minimal risk exposure.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Strict Access Controls:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and least privilege principles.
- **Continuous Verification:** Identity, code, and infrastructure validation at each pipeline stage.
- **Automated Security Scans:** Integrated tools for SAST, DAST, dependency analysis, and container security.
- **Incident Reporting:** Centralized vulnerability tracking and management.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Real-time logging and anomaly detection to secure the pipeline and environment.
- **Data Encryption:** Secure sensitive data in transit and at rest.
