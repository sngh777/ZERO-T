        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Zero Trust is a security model that requires continuous verification of all users and systems, regardless of their location, before granting access to critical resources. This model helps mitigate security risks and ensures stronger control over sensitive data and applications.</p>
        <p>Adopting a Zero Trust strategy allows organizations to reduce the impact of breaches, gain better visibility into network activities, and maintain compliance with security regulations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-content" id="tab2">
        <h2>Zero Trust Principles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strict Access Controls:</strong> Only authorized users and systems are allowed access, with continuous verification to maintain trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Least Privilege:</strong> Users and systems are granted the minimum necessary access rights to perform their tasks, reducing the potential attack surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Micro-Segmentation:</strong> Networks are divided into smaller zones to minimize lateral movement by attackers.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Real-time analysis of user activities and system behaviors to detect and mitigate potential threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> Encrypting data both at rest and in transit ensures that sensitive information remains protected.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-content" id="tab3">
        <h2>Aspects of Zero Trust Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identity and Access Management (IAM):</strong> Strong user authentication and access control mechanisms to protect critical resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Secrets Management:</strong> Secure storage and management of sensitive credentials, API keys, and other secrets.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> Continuous monitoring and segmentation to protect data flows and prevent unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Encryption and access controls to safeguard sensitive data both at rest and in transit.</li>
            <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> Rapid detection and containment of security threats to minimize damage.</li>
        </ul>
